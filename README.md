## 📖 The Problem

In today's information-rich environment, critical knowledge is fragmented across different formats:

- 📄 Important reports buried in PDFs
- 📊 Key data locked in screenshots  
- 🎙️ Context hidden in audio recordings
- 📝 Notes scattered across text files

Traditional search is limited to keyword matching, making it time-consuming and inefficient to extract meaningful insights. Worse yet, most AI solutions require cloud connectivity and force you to upload sensitive data to third-party servers.

## ✨ The Solution

**Glimpse** brings the power of modern RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) directly to your desktop. It runs **completely on your machine**, ensuring your data remains private while enabling intelligent semantic search and conversational AI across all your documents.

## 💡 Philosophy

Glimpse is built on three core principles:

1. **Privacy is Non-Negotiable**: Your data is yours. Period.
2. **Intelligence Should Be Accessible**: Powerful AI shouldn't require cloud infrastructure
3. **Knowledge Should Be Connected**: Break down silos between formats and files
